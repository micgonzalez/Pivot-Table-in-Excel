# Pivot Table in Excel

# Introduction
This repository is based on creating a pivot table in the Excel program. I was tasked to created one for a status update.

# Abstract
I was tasked to create a pivot table in the spreedsheet program, Excel. This pivot table was going to look at the color paint sales by the regions. It was used to in part of a status update.


# Summary of Skills
I used the windows environment with the Excel program to complete this project.

This Screenshot was created from this project to show the public about encoding a color histogram as features.

# Findings
I was amazed in my initial findings that some colors out sold others in certain regions of the country. I was glad to that this data was able to show me some useful insights. 

# Challenges
There wasn't any major challenges for me. In Excel, there are many usseful functions that allow to transform the worksheet into pivot tables and data visualizations.  

# Conclusion
When I was done with this project, I noticed it took a less amount of time. I was compairing the time spent with functions done in the python environment. Using the Excel program allowed me to focus on other projects.
