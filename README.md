# Findings
I was amazed in my initial findings that some colors out sold others in certain regions of the country. I was glad to that this data was able to show me some useful insights.

# Conclusion
When I was done with this project, I noticed it took a less amount of time. I was compairing the time spent with functions done in the python environment. Using the Excel program allowed me to focus on other projects.
